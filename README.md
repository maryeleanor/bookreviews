# Bookreads

## Project 1 for CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This is a bookclub website for users to search books and leave reviews and ratings. 
The average ratings and number of reviews are pulled in from Goodreads as well to show a wider audience.

Users can also get book details via API access. 
If users make a GET request to the website’s /api/<isbn> route, where <isbn> is a 10 digi ISBN number, we return a JSON response containing the book’s title, author, publication date, ISBN number, review count, and average score.
